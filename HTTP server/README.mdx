# Simple HTTP 1.1 Server with CRUD Operations

## Concurrency

- Only one thread can modify database at the time.
  [`std::lock_guard lock()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/lock_guard.html)
  used to ensure thread-safe access to shared resources.

- Each client gets its own thread to handle requests.
