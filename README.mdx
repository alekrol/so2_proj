# Dining Philosophers Problem

## Problem description

1. There are N philosophers
2. There are N chopsticks
3. Philosophers either eat or think
4. Every philosopher needs two chopsticks to eat - left and right
5. A philosopher can only eat if their neighbors are not eating

## Solution

We need to ensure that a philosopher sets their state to EATING only if it's
safe to do so.

There are 3 states philosophers can be in:

1. THINKING
2. HUNGRY
3. EATING

Life cycle of a philosopher: THINKING -> HUNGRY -> EATING -> repeat

<br>
or in other words: 
<br>
think (sleep (1)) -> pick up chopsticks -> eat (sleep (1)) -> put down
chopsticks -> repeat

We need to implement the following functions:

1. `test` checks if a philosopher can start eating
   - returns true if neighbors are not eating
2. `pickUpChopsticks`
   - sets state to HUNGRY
   - waits
   - sets state to EATING
3. `putDownChopsticks`
   - sets state to THINKING
   - notifies neighbors
4. `philosopherThread`:
   - think (sleep)
   - pickUpChopsticks
   - eat (sleep)
   - putDownChopsticks
   - repeat
